    <p>I am 17 years old and I live in Paris. I am keen on traveling (my profile picture was taken in Grenada in the Caribean sea... How stunning!). Moreover, on my free time, I practice <a href="https://fft.fr" target="_blank">tennis</a> with my brothers.  </p>

    <h2> Fashion <i class="fa-solid fa-socks"></i></h2>
    <p>I love shopping 2nd hand clothes. It is better for the environment, but also for your wallet! (you should also start buying second hand clothes, trust me!) </p>

     <h2>Traveling <i class="fa-solid fa-earth-americas"></i></h2>
    <p>I was lucky to be born in Martinique. Then I moved to French Guyana as well as Guadeloupe. It was very enriching to live abroad, where the culture is different (although it is French...) All of this aroused my curiosity, and since then I have loved traveling to discover new landscapes.  </p>

    <h2>Cats <i class="fa-solid fa-cat"></i></h2>
    <p>I have always lived with a cat since my birth. He is my favorite animal because he is attentive, cuddly but also energetic.</p>
